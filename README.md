# Using cognitive psychology to understand GPT-3

Data and code to reproduce our analyses. Preprint available [here](http://cpilab.org/pubs/Binz2022GPT3.pdf).


**Abstract**: We study GPT-3, a recent large language model, using tools from cognitive psychology. More specifically, we assess GPT-3’sdecision-making, information search, deliberation, and causal reasoning abilities on a battery of canonical experiments from theliterature. We find that much of GPT-3’s behavior is impressive: it solves vignette-based tasks similarly or better than humansubjects, is able to make decent decisions from descriptions, outperforms humans in a multi-armed bandit task, and showssignatures of model-based reinforcement learning. Yet we also find that small perturbations to vignette-based tasks can leadGPT-3 vastly astray, that it shows no signatures of directed exploration, and that it fails miserably in a causal reasoning task.These results enrich our understanding of current large language models and pave the way for future investigations using toolsfrom cognitive psychology to study increasingly capable and opaque artificial agents.
